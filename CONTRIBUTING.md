# Contributing

Hello! Welcome to Appstract's contribution guide.

## Icons

You're welcome to designs icons for apps you'd like to see supported by Appstract.

Don't know what to add, but just want to help? See Appstract's [most-requested icons]().

To add new icons to Appstract, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository. If you've never done this before, see Github's guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
2. Open one of the template icons in the `svgs` folder. Save it to have the name of your new icon, and design your icon. Icons use a document size of 192x192 pixels, and a stroke size of 6px. See the template icon for other details.
3. Export the icons to the `appstract-light` folder with black lines, and to the `appstract-dark` folder with white lines.
4. Open a pull request and explain your changes. [Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
5. Provide the activity names of the icons you've added in your pull request.
    - These should look something like `com.dkanada.icecons/com.dkanada.icecons.MainActivity`, and if youre app is in the list of [most-requested icons](), you should be able to find it there. Note that there may be multiple of these names for each app.


## Code

I don't have any plans for code changes - Appstract is currently built on [Sarsa Murmu's](https://github.com/sarsamurmu) maintined Candybar fork: [zixpo/candybar-sample](https://github.com/zixpo/candybar-sample). If you want to contribute to that, head over to his repo :)
